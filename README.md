Welcome!
I worked on this app mainly for two reasons. First by writing code to run this app am showcasing my node and MongoDB development and integrations skills. secondly but not least I am showing here my ability to work on git.

In this project, I'll advanced features of the node.js package to create an online shop website.So, stay tuned!!!

Node.js technologies used:
-express.js
    -body-parser for extracting request bodies
    -building routes for middleware
    -filter request by path using methods(get, post...)
    -serveing files through:
        -senfFiles  such as html
        -express.static to serve files statically (managing external css avail in express.js)
